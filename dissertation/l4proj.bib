abstract = {Before new technologies enter the market, their environmental superiority over competing options must be asserted based on a life cycle approach. However, when applying the prevailing status-quo Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach to future renewable energy systems, one does not distinguish between impacts which are ‘imported’ into the system due to the ‘background system’ (e.g. due to supply of materials or final energy for the production of the energy system), and what is the improvement potential of these technologies compared to competitors (e.g. due to process and system innovations or diffusion effects). This paper investigates a dynamic approach towards the LCA of renewable energy technologies and proves that for all renewable energy chains, the inputs of finite energy resources and emissions of greenhouse gases are extremely low compared with the conventional system. With regard to the other environmental impacts the findings do not reveal any clear verdict for or against renewable energies. Future development will enable a further reduction of environmental impacts of renewable energy systems. Different factors are responsible for this development, such as progress with respect to technical parameters of energy converters, in particular, improved efficiency; emissions characteristics; increased lifetime, etc.; advances with regard to the production process of energy converters and fuels; and advances with regard to ‘external’ services originating from conventional energy and transport systems, for instance, improved electricity or process heat supply for system production and ecologically optimized transport systems for fuel transportation. The application of renewable energy sources might modify not only the background system, but also further downstream aspects, such as consumer behavior. This effect is, however, strongly context and technology dependent.}

In this paper, we aim at assessing the global carbon footprint of the overall ICT industry, including the contribution from the main consumer devices, the data centers and communication networks, and compare it with the to the total worldwide GHGE. We conduct a detailed and rigorous analysis of the ICT global carbon footprint, including both the production and the operational energy of ICT devices, as well as the operational energy for the supporting ICT infrastructure. We then compare this contribution to the global 2016-level GHGE. We have found that, if unchecked, ICT GHGE relative contribution could grow from roughly 1–1.6% in 2007 to exceed 14% of the 2016-level worldwide GHGE by 2040, accounting for more than half of the current relative contribution of the whole transportation sector. Our study also highlights the contribution of smart phones and shows that by 2020, the footprint of smart phones alone would surpass the individual contribution of desktops, laptops and displays. Finally, we offer some actionable recommendations on how to mitigate and curb the ICT explosive GHGE footprint, through a combination of renewable energy use, tax policies, managerial actions and alternative business models.}

Examples of systems that might be evaluated using DES include: queueing systems, such as a bank service counter, where customers arrive occasionally and may wait in lines for service; manufacturing systems, where parts are processed in various sequences at differ-ent stations; and inventory systems, where random quantities of a certain product are purchased by customers each day at a store, which in turn may cause additional actions along the product supply chain. These systems are driven by various events that occur at discrete times and change the state of the simulation. Event times correspond to, for example: customer arrivals, customer departures from a server or from the system, machine breakdowns, and even an ``end-of-simulation'' event. In this chapter, we will give a high-level description of how a DES works, followed by a running example illustrating the salient concepts, and then a brief discussion of specialty DES software.",

To demonstrate the use of the concepts, a discrete system is modeled using the event-scheduling perspective.

In this paper, we critique ICT's current and projected climate impacts. Peer-reviewed studies estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%–2.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could actually be between 2.1% and 3.9%. For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.}

ABSTRACT = {Agriculture is one of the economic sectors that affect climate change contributing to greenhouse gas emissions directly and indirectly. There is a trend of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions reduction, but any practice in this direction should not affect negatively farm productivity and economics because this would limit its implementation, due to the high global food and feed demand and the competitive environment in this sector. Precision agriculture practices using high-tech equipment has the ability to reduce agricultural inputs by site-specific applications, as it better target inputs to spatial and temporal needs of the fields, which can result in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Precision agriculture can also have a positive impact on farm productivity and economics, as it provides higher or equal yields with lower production cost than conventional practices. In this work, precision agriculture technologies that have the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are presented providing a short description of the technology and the impacts that have been reported in literature on greenhouse gases reduction and the associated impacts on farm productivity and economics. The technologies presented span all agricultural practices, including variable rate sowing/planting, fertilizing, spraying, weeding and irrigation.},

abstract = {In recent years, the devices that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm have been increasing in number and complexity as different layers of network computing, such as Cloud, Edge and Fog Computing, have emerged. Thanks to these latest paradigms and their different types of communications, it has been possible to reduce and distribute the computational load on the network. However, to build these infrastructures and reduce the cost, it is necessary to use a simulation platform to model these environments and analyze their behavior (power consumption, CPU usage, bandwidth, etc.) beforehand. An essential aspect of simulators is scalability, the ability to add new components and simulate large infrastructures without compromising the performance of the simulator. Many existing simulators, as will be discussed in this article, cannot scale adequately as new elements are added to the system. Furthermore, in these environments, it is useful to simulate mobile devices and to know the location of these devices for the development and analysis of new algorithms. To solve these problems, this article presents and describes the ENIGMA simulator. ENIGMA is a scalable simulator of Edge, Fog and Cloud computing infrastructures, which allows to efficiently simulate a large number of devices and elements and to analyze different characteristics (CPU usage, power consumption, network bandwidth, application execution time, etc.). Its objective is to analyze new infrastructures and algorithms. ENIGMA also includes support for including mobile devices and an API to integrate their visualization in graphical maps. The article presents an evaluation to compare the scalability of ENIGMA with other state-of-the-art simulators and different use cases that illustrate its operation.}
