In addition to this Extended LEAF also sees to introduce visualisation features to allow the user to analyse results.

ECO-LEAF is an extension of the [LEAF](https://leaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project developed by [Philipp Wiesner](https://github.com/birnbaum) and [Lauritz Thamsen](https://github.com/lauritzthamsen).
